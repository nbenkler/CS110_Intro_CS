Values:
	Numbers
	Digits in number (if number is n digits long (x1, x2, x3,..., xn)
	length of the number

Functions
	Digit to the number of digits in the whole string
	Digit^length + Digit^length....
	Is digit^length + digit^length... equal to origional number

Pseudocode
	1. read list of numbers
	2. take the next number
	3. take every digit of the number to the length of the number
	4. add every digit together
	5. if every digit of the number to the length of the number = the number print "_____ is an armstrong number." and continue
	5. else go back to step 2
